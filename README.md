# Outlook.com-emails-to-Excel-Python
Pull the contents of outlook.com emails to excel using python

The code is contained in the femail.py file uploaded. The code basically displays how to access outlook.com emails from python, get there contents and then pull them onto an excel worksheet. 

For an example, I have accessd the outlook email to search for one prticular email that I get every week in the form of a table that has been pasted on the email body. I want that table to autmoaticlly be updated on an excel sheet where each value will be pasted to its corresponding place in the excel sheet.

I have used the the imaplib library to access my outlook.com emails and have used the openpyxl library to write to an excel sheet.
